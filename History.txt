== 0.2.0 / 2009-09-03

* API change: switch to using the word "conversion" instead of
  "migration" throughout the library.  While this was mostly a
  find-and-replace job, I'm bumping the version number to indicate the
  API breakage.

  I'd found that using the word "migration" got people thinking in terms
  of ActiveRecord, which isn't quite the intended purpose of this
  library.  SQrbL was written to manage the process of doing one-off
  database conversions in a repeatable way.

  (At raSANTIAGO, I helped a few organizations switch from other
  programs to CiviCRM, and I wrote SQrbL to help me keep track of all
  the various steps involved in importing their legacy
  constituent-management data to CiviCRM.)

== 0.1.3 / 2009-08-07

* Added Step#helpers method for code cosmetics.

== 0.1.2 / 2009-08-06

* No changes -- just want to make sure the latest release is actually
  usable after flailing around trying to use the 'bones' and 'rubyforge'
  gems.

== 0.1.0 / 2009-08-06

* Ready for public consumption?
