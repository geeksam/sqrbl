- bin/sqrbl should create an empty SQrbL file with the following simple template:
    require 'rubygems'
    require 'sqrbl'
    Sqrbl.migration do
      # (copy the rest from README.txt)
    end

- Writers should create some sort of output to let you know that something happened.

- Define #helper(&block) as a simple wrapper to instance_eval on the same object.  (Purpose:  allow you to define helpers in a block that can be code-folded.)
