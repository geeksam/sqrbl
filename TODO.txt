- Change verbiage: "conversion" instead of "migration".

- Writers should create some sort of output to let you know that something happened.

- bin/sqrbl should create an empty SQrbL file with the following simple template:
    require 'rubygems'
    require 'sqrbl'
    Sqrbl.conversion do
      # (copy the rest from README.txt)
    end

- Add some string-munging for pluralize(n, thing, things), and possibly move #unix_name into the string-munging module.
