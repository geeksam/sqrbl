- Writers should create some sort of output to let you know that something happened.

- bin/sqrbl should create an empty SQrbL file with the following simple template:
    require 'sqrbl'   # but not rubygems, because apparently that's evil
    Sqrbl.conversion do
      # (copy the rest from README.txt)
    end

- Add some string-munging for pluralize(n, thing, things), and possibly move #unix_name into the string-munging module.

- SQL helpers:
    inner_join(expr, alias, join_expr)
    outer_join(expr, alias, join_expr)
    join(join_type, expr, alias, join_expr)
  Move these into a module, mix same into Step?
